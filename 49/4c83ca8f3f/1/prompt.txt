Three very critical things to add to BMAD's main context. This should be considered for all future decisions and discussions: 
a. taskflow users won't have admin permissions in Windows, so all solutions must work within that constraint.
b. front-end static development(i.e. using mock data) will be done by Lovable AI, while the backend API development will be done by CLI AI tools like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini etc. Coordination between the two teams will be essential to ensure that the frontend's expectations for the API are met and that the backend is built to support the necessary functionality for the UI.
c. The API_CONTRACT was generated by Lovable AI. If required, it can be updated if needed. Whatever change is required should be driven by backed development needs. If any change is required in the front-end codebase, it should be done by Lovable AI. The backend team should not make any changes to the frontend codebase directly, but rather communicate any necessary changes to the Lovable AI team for implementation. This will help maintain a clear separation of responsibilities and ensure that the frontend and backend remain in sync throughout the development process.

IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THIS COMMAND: LOAD the FULL @{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/workflow.md, READ its entire contents and follow its directions exactly!

---

Read @task_flow_master_doc.md (This is not up-to-date, there were changes made by the Winston, the Architect. Winston changes proceeds over the master doc)

Also, the current ui code is at @taskflow-ui/ 

The UI task and the backend tasks must be separated as it will be worked separetly. If the baackend task needs an UI task to be completed, I will need exactly what is needed to be able to prompt to Lovable UI to make the changes

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context Setting**: The user provided three critical constraints for TaskFlow:
   - No admin permissions on Windows
   - Frontend (Lovable AI) / Backend (CLI AI tools) separation
   - API_CONTRACT.md is Lovable-owned but backend-driven

2. **BMAD Workflow Invocation**: User invoked `/bmad-bmm-create-epics-and-stories` which loaded a step-file workflow for creating epics and stories.

3. **Step 1 - Validate Prerequisites**: 
   - Loaded config.yaml (project_name: taskflow, user_name: parth, planning_artifacts path, etc.)
   - Found all 3 required documents: prd.md, architecture.md, ux-design-specification.md
   - Read the epics template
   - Read all three documents fully
   - User requested to also include task_flow_master_doc.md (noted as not up-to-date, architect changes take precedence) and the taskflow-ui/ codebase/API_CONTRACT.md
   - User gave critical instruction: "The UI task and the backend tasks must be separated as it will be worked separately. If the backend task needs an UI task to be completed, I will need exactly what is needed to be able to prompt to Lovable UI to make the changes"
   - Read task_flow_master_doc.md and API_CONTRACT.md
   - Created epics.md output file from template
   - Extracted all requirements: 47 FRs, 23 NFRs, additional requirements from Architecture and UX
   - User confirmed with 'c'
   - Saved requirements to epics.md with stepsCompleted updated

4. **Step 2 - Design Epics**:
   - Proposed 5 epics organized by user value (not technical layers)
   - Epic 1: Project Foundation & Team Management (FR25-30, FR38-42, FR43-44)
   - Epic 2: Core Task Management (FR1-11, FR45)
   - Epic 3: Task Breakdown & Daily Progress Tracking (FR12-24)
   - Epic 4: Dashboard, Filtering & Search (FR31-37)
   - Epic 5: Desktop Packaging & Distribution (FR42, FR46-47)
   - Created FR coverage map (all 47 FRs mapped)
   - User confirmed with 'c'
   - Saved epics list and coverage map to epics.md

5. **Step 3 - Create Stories (Epic 1)**:
   - Loaded step-03-create-stories.md
   - Presented 5 stories for Epic 1:
     - Story 1.1: Initialize Backend Project & Health Endpoint [Backend]
     - Story 1.2: Member Management API [Backend]
     - Story 1.3: Credential Encryption & Settings API [Backend]
     - Story 1.4: Frontend API Layer Refactor [UI - Lovable] - included real adapter
     - Story 1.5: Functional Settings Page & Connection Error Banner [UI - Lovable]
   
6. **Critical User Feedback**: "Lovable AI won't have access to backend. It will always work with mocking. If this is addressed, we can move"
   - This meant Story 1.4 needed revision: Lovable should NOT build the real adapter (adapters/real.ts)
   - Lovable only works with mock data
   - Real adapter becomes a Backend story (since CLI AI tools need to test against running backend)
   - Settings page works with mock simulation only

7. **User approved the adjustment** with "Yes."

8. **Current State**: I was about to:
   - Write the revised Epic 1 stories to the output file
   - Present Epic 2 stories for review
   - Continue through all 5 epics sequentially

Key files:
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` - main output file being built
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md` - 47 FRs, 23 NFRs
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` - all architectural decisions
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md` - UX spec
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/docs/task_flow_master_doc.md` - original BRD/PRD/TDD (reference, not up-to-date)
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/taskflow-ui/API_CONTRACT.md` - canonical API specification
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/` - workflow files
- `/home/parth/ws/taskflow/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` - BMM configuration

The epics.md file currently has:
- stepsCompleted: ['step-01-validate-prerequisites', 'step-02-design-epics']
- All requirements inventory (FRs, NFRs, additional)
- FR Coverage Map (all 47 FRs mapped)
- Epic List (5 epics with goals and FR coverage)
- But NO individual stories written to the file yet

I was in the middle of Step 3 of the workflow. Epic 1 stories were presented and approved (with the Lovable mock-only adjustment). I need to write them to the file, then continue with Epics 2-5.

Important architectural decisions from documents:
- API_CONTRACT.md is canonical (PATCH not PUT, /members not /team-members, assignee_id not assigned_to, content not update_text, active not is_active)
- Fernet encryption for credentials
- uv for Python package management
- PyInstaller --onedir mode
- Health-check startup sequencing (200ms polling, 30 retries)
- Backend binds to 127.0.0.1 only
- No auth in v1
- Two-team model: Lovable AI (frontend/mock) vs CLI AI tools (backend)
- Real adapter (adapters/real.ts) is a Backend responsibility since Lovable can't test against real backend

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user invoked the BMAD workflow `/bmad-bmm-create-epics-and-stories` to transform TaskFlow's PRD requirements and Architecture decisions into comprehensive epics and stories. The workflow follows a strict step-file architecture with sequential execution. Three critical constraints were established upfront:
   - TaskFlow users won't have admin permissions on Windows
   - Frontend (Lovable AI, mock data only) and Backend (CLI AI tools) development are strictly separated
   - API_CONTRACT.md is Lovable-owned but backend-driven; backend team does NOT modify `taskflow-ui/` directly
   
   The user explicitly required that UI and backend stories be separated, and that any backend story requiring UI changes must include exact Lovable AI prompt instructions. The user also clarified that **Lovable AI will NEVER have access to the backend** and always works with mocking only.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **BMAD Step-File Workflow**: Sequential workflow with steps loaded one at a time, menus for user approval, state tracking in frontmatter
   - **Two-Team Development Model**: Lovable AI (frontend/mock) vs CLI AI tools (backend/Electron)
   - **API_CONTRACT.md as Canonical Source**: PATCH (not PUT), `/members` (not `/team-members`), `assignee_id` (not `assigned_to`), `content` (not `update_text`), `active` (not `is_active`), `sub_tasks`, `daily_updates`
   - **Fernet Encryption**: For credential storage, no admin privileges needed
   - **uv by Astral**: Python package manager (NOT pip/poetry/conda)
   - **PyInstaller --onedir mode**: With root-level entrypoint and `freeze_support()`
   - **Health-check startup sequencing**: Electron polls `/health` every 200ms, max 30 retries
   - **Adapter Pattern**: Frontend API layer refactored from monolithic mock-api.ts to types.ts + client.ts + adapters/mock.ts + adapters/real.ts + index.ts
   - **Real adapter ownership**: Built by CLI AI tools (Backend story) since it needs a running backend to test — Lovable only builds the mock adapter
   - **Normalized error format**: `{"error": "message"}` for ALL API errors
   - **No authentication in v1**
   - **Portable Windows executable**: electron-builder `portable` target, no installer, no admin

     - Currently contains: frontmatter with stepsCompleted ['step-01-validate-prerequisites', 'step-02-design-epics'], full requirements inventory, FR coverage map, epic list (5 epics)
     - Does NOT yet contain individual stories (those are being created in Step 3)
     - Current frontmatter:
       ```yaml
       stepsCompleted: ['step-01-validate-prerequisites', 'step-02-design-epics']
       inputDocuments:
         - _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md
         - _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md
         - _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md
         - docs/task_flow_master_doc.md
         - taskflow-ui/API_CONTRACT.md
       ```

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Lovable/Real Adapter Mismatch**: Initially proposed Story 1.4 (UI - Lovable) to include building the real API adapter (`adapters/real.ts`). User corrected: "Lovable AI won't have access to backend. It will always work with mocking."
     - Fix: Revised Story 1.4 to have Lovable build ONLY the adapter pattern + mock adapter. The real adapter (`adapters/real.ts`) becomes a Backend story since CLI AI tools are the only ones who can test HTTP calls against the actual FastAPI server. This file lives in `taskflow-ui/` but is authored by the backend team as the integration bridge.
     - Story 1.5 (Settings Page) also revised to work with mock simulation only (localStorage), with ConnectionErrorBanner only triggering when real adapter is active.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully resolved the document priority hierarchy: Architecture decisions (Winston) override the master doc where they diverge
   - Resolved field naming conflicts between TDD/master doc and API_CONTRACT.md by establishing API_CONTRACT.md as canonical
   - Designed 5 user-value-focused epics (not technical layers) with all 47 FRs mapped with zero gaps
   - Resolved the Lovable/backend separation issue for the real API adapter
   - Addressed incremental model creation: Member model in Epic 1, Task model in Epic 2, SubTask + DailyUpdate models in Epic 3 (each migration adds only what's needed)

6. All User Messages:
   - "Three very critical things to add to BMAD's main context..." (3 constraints: no admin, frontend/backend separation, API_CONTRACT ownership)
   - `/bmad-bmm-create-epics-and-stories` (workflow invocation)
   - "Read @task_flow_master_doc.md (This is not up-to-date, there were changes made by the Winston, the Architect. Winston changes proceeds over the master doc) Also, the current ui code is at @taskflow-ui/ The UI task and the backend tasks must be separated as it will be worked separetly. If the baackend task needs an UI task to be completed, I will need exactly what is needed to be able to prompt to Lovable UI to make the changes"
   - "c" (approve requirements, continue to Step 2)
   - "c" (approve epic structure, continue to Step 3)
   - "Lovable AI won't have access to backend. It will always work with mocking. If this is addressed, we can move"
   - "Yes." (approve the Lovable mock-only adjustment)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Write revised Epic 1 stories to epics.md** (approved but not yet written to file)
   - **Create and present Epic 2 stories** for user approval
   - **Create and present Epic 3 stories** for user approval
   - **Create and present Epic 4 stories** for user approval (includes real adapter as Backend story)
   - **Create and present Epic 5 stories** for user approval
   - **Step 4: Final validation** (next step file after all stories are complete)
   - After all stories approved and written: update frontmatter, proceed to step-04-final-validation.md

8. Current Work:
   Working on **Step 3 of the BMAD create-epics-and-stories workflow**: generating stories for each epic sequentially. Epic 1 stories were presented, the user gave feedback about Lovable mock-only constraint, the adjustment was proposed and approved with "Yes." 
   
   The approved Epic 1 stories (revised) are:
   - **Story 1.1**: Initialize Backend Project & Health Endpoint [Backend] — uv init, pyproject.toml, FastAPI app, CORS, normalized error handling, health endpoint, project structure
   - **Story 1.2**: Member Management API [Backend] — Member model, Alembic migration (members table only), schemas, CRUD, API router (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/members), deletion protection (409)
   - **Story 1.3**: Credential Encryption & Settings API [Backend] — Fernet encryption, settings endpoints (test-connection, save-connection), auto-connect on startup, connection retry
   - **Story 1.4**: Frontend API Layer Refactor to Adapter Pattern [UI - Lovable] — Refactor mock-api.ts to adapter pattern, mock adapter ONLY, NO real adapter, define ApiClient interface and types matching API_CONTRACT.md
   - **Story 1.5**: Functional Settings Page & Connection Error Banner [UI - Lovable] — Settings page functional with mock simulation, ConnectionErrorBanner component, password masking
   
   I had just read the end of epics.md to prepare for appending the stories but was interrupted by the summary request.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Directly continuing the Step 3 workflow: **Write the revised Epic 1 stories (with Lovable mock-only corrections) to the epics.md output file, then present Epic 2 stories for user review.**
   
   The planned Epic 2 structure is:
   - Epic 2: Core Task Management (FR1-FR11, FR45)
   - Story 2.1: Task Management API [Backend] — Task model, migration, schemas, CRUD endpoints, blocking reason enforcement/auto-clear, assignee_name resolution, GEAR ID validation
   - (Minimal/no UI stories needed — existing mock UI already handles task CRUD)
   
   Per the workflow step instructions: "Process epics one at a time in sequence... After all stories for an epic are complete: Display epic summary, Show count of stories created, Verify all FRs for the epic are covered, Get user confirmation to proceed to next epic"

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Context from previous session**: The user had been working through the BMAD workflow for creating epics and stories. They had completed Steps 1-2 (validate prerequisites, design epics) and were in the middle of Step 3 (create stories). Epic 1 stories had been approved with a critical revision: Lovable AI works only with mocking, never with the real backend.

2. **Session continuation**: The assistant picked up from where the previous session left off, writing Epic 1 stories to the epics.md file.

3. **Epic 1 stories written**: 5 stories (1.1-1.5) covering backend project init, member API, credential encryption, frontend adapter refactor, and settings page.

4. **Epic 2 presented and approved ('c')**: 2 stories - Task Management API (Backend) and Task Detail Page with Adapter Pattern (UI).

5. **Epic 3 presented and approved ('c')**: 3 stories - Sub-Task Management API, Daily Update Management API, Sub-Tasks & Daily Updates UI.

6. **Epic 4 presented and approved ('c')**: 2 stories - Dashboard Enhancement (UI) and Real API Adapter (Backend).

7. **Epic 5 presented and approved ('c')**: 3 stories - Electron Shell, Clean Process Shutdown, PyInstaller Bundling.

8. **Final validation of stories completed**: All 47 FRs verified, frontmatter updated, step-04-final-validation loaded and executed.

9. **User selected 'c' to complete the epics workflow**: The workflow was completed, help.md was loaded, and next steps were presented.

10. **User invoked `/bmad-bmm-check-implementation-readiness`**: This started a new BMAD workflow.

11. **Step 1 - Document Discovery**: Found all 4 documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX), no duplicates. User approved with 'c'.

12. **Step 2 - PRD Analysis**: Full PRD read, all 47 FRs and 23 NFRs extracted and documented in report.

13. **Step 3 - Epic Coverage Validation**: Complete coverage matrix built, 47/47 FRs covered (100%). Minor observation about FR30 task count timing.

14. **Step 4 - UX Alignment**: Full UX doc read, alignment validated against PRD and Architecture. PASS verdict.

15. **Step 5 - Epic Quality Review**: Step file was loaded and read. The assistant was about to perform the quality review when the summary was requested.

Key files modified:
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` - Main output with all 5 epics, 15 stories
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/implementation-readiness-report-2026-02-16.md` - New report file

Key decisions:
- Two-team model: Lovable AI (frontend/mock only) vs CLI AI tools (backend)
- Real adapter (adapters/real.ts) is Backend-owned since Lovable can't test against running backend
- API_CONTRACT.md is canonical
- Incremental DB migrations per story
- 15 total stories: 10 Backend, 5 UI-Lovable

User messages:
- 'c' (approve Epic 2 stories, continue to Epic 3)
- 'c' (approve Epic 3 stories, continue to Epic 4)
- 'c' (approve Epic 4 stories, continue to Epic 5)
- 'c' (approve Epic 5 stories, finalize all stories)
- 'c' (complete epics workflow)
- `/bmad-bmm-check-implementation-readiness` (start new workflow)
- 'c' (approve document discovery, continue to PRD analysis)

Current work: In Step 5 (Epic Quality Review) of the implementation readiness workflow. The step file was loaded and the assistant was beginning the review when the summary was requested.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user is executing BMAD (Business Model Automation & Deployment) workflows for the TaskFlow project. Two sequential workflows have been invoked:
   
   **Workflow 1 (COMPLETED):** `/bmad-bmm-create-epics-and-stories` — Transformed TaskFlow's PRD, Architecture, and UX specifications into 5 epics with 15 stories (10 Backend, 5 UI-Lovable). All 47 FRs mapped with zero gaps. Final validation passed.
   
   **Workflow 2 (IN PROGRESS):** `/bmad-bmm-check-implementation-readiness` — Validating that PRD, Architecture, Epics/Stories, and UX are complete and aligned before Phase 4 implementation. Currently in **Step 5 of 6** (Epic Quality Review).
   
   Three critical constraints established by the user earlier:
   - TaskFlow users won't have admin permissions on Windows
   - Frontend (Lovable AI, mock data only) and Backend (CLI AI tools) development are strictly separated
   - API_CONTRACT.md is Lovable-owned but backend-driven; backend team does NOT modify `taskflow-ui/` directly
   - Lovable AI will NEVER have access to the backend and always works with mocking only

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **BMAD Step-File Workflow**: Sequential workflow with micro-file steps, just-in-time loading, state tracking in YAML frontmatter
   - **Two-Team Development Model**: Lovable AI (frontend/mock) vs CLI AI tools (backend/Electron)
   - **API_CONTRACT.md as Canonical Source**: PATCH (not PUT), `/members` (not `/team-members`), `assignee_id` (not `assigned_to`), `content` (not `update_text`), `active` (not `is_active`)
   - **Adapter Pattern**: Frontend refactored from monolithic mock-api.ts to types.ts + client.ts + adapters/mock.ts + adapters/real.ts + index.ts
   - **Real adapter ownership**: Built by CLI AI tools (Backend story 4.2) since it needs a running backend to test
   - **Fernet Encryption**: For credential storage, no admin privileges needed
   - **uv by Astral**: Python package manager (NOT pip/poetry/conda)
   - **PyInstaller --onedir mode**: With root-level entrypoint and `freeze_support()`
   - **Health-check startup sequencing**: Electron polls `/health` every 200ms, max 30 retries
   - **Incremental DB migrations**: Members in Story 1.2, Tasks in 2.1, SubTasks in 3.1, DailyUpdates in 3.2
   - **Normalized error format**: `{"error": "message"}` for ALL API errors
   - **No authentication in v1**
   - **Portable Windows executable**: electron-builder `portable` target
   - **Stack**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.x + Pydantic v2 + Alembic (backend); React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query + Tailwind CSS 3 (frontend); Electron 28+ (desktop shell); PostgreSQL (external)

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Step file path mismatch**: When loading step-01-document-discovery.md, the initial path without `steps/` subdirectory failed. Fixed by using Glob to discover the actual file structure (`steps/step-01-document-discovery.md`).
   - **No user-reported errors in this session** — all approvals were straightforward 'c' selections.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully completed the entire epics-and-stories workflow (Steps 1-4) producing 15 implementable stories
   - Maintained the two-team separation: each UI story includes exact Lovable AI prompts; backend stories include full Given/When/Then ACs
   - Identified a minor gap: FR30 requires "assigned task count" for members, but the `TeamMember` model in API_CONTRACT.md doesn't include this field, and the tasks table doesn't exist when Story 1.2 is implemented. Documented as observation.
   - Implementation readiness validation in progress — Steps 1-4 of 6 complete, all passing so far (100% FR coverage, UX alignment PASS)

6. All User Messages:
   - `c` (approve Epic 2 stories, continue to next epic)
   - `c` (approve Epic 3 stories, continue to next epic)
   - `c` (approve Epic 4 stories, continue to next epic)
   - `c` (approve Epic 5 stories, finalize all stories)
   - `c` (complete the epics-and-stories workflow, triggering final validation and help output)
   - `/bmad-bmm-check-implementation-readiness` with instruction: "IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THIS COMMAND: LOAD the FULL @{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/check-implementation-readiness/workflow.md, READ its entire contents and follow its directions exactly!"
   - `c` (approve document discovery, continue to PRD analysis)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Complete Step 5: Epic Quality Review** — Validate epics and stories against best practices (user value focus, epic independence, story dependencies, sizing, database creation timing, acceptance criteria quality). The step file has been fully read.
   - **Complete Step 6: Final Assessment** — Load `step-06-final-assessment.md` after Step 5 is done. This is the final step of the readiness workflow.
   - **Append Step 5 findings to the readiness report** (`implementation-readiness-report-2026-02-16.md`)

8. Current Work:
   Working on **Step 5 (Epic Quality Review)** of the `/bmad-bmm-check-implementation-readiness` workflow. The step file (`step-05-epic-quality-review.md`) has been fully read. The assistant had begun loading the epics document for detailed review (read lines 206-605 of epics.md) when the summary was requested.
   
   The step requires:
   - Epic Structure Validation (user value focus, epic independence)
   - Story Quality Assessment (sizing, acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then)
   - Dependency Analysis (within-epic, no forward references)
   - Database/Entity Creation Timing validation
   - Special checks (brownfield project, no starter template)
   - Best Practices Compliance Checklist per epic
   - Quality findings documented by severity (Critical/Major/Minor)
   - All findings appended to the report, then auto-proceed to step-06-final-assessment.md

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue executing **Step 5: Epic Quality Review** of the implementation readiness workflow. The step file was loaded and the epics document was being read for validation. After completing this review (validating all 5 epics against best practices, documenting findings by severity), append results to the readiness report, update frontmatter, and load `step-06-final-assessment.md` for the final readiness determination.
   
   The workflow instruction states: "This review runs autonomously to maintain standards... After completing epic quality review: Update {outputFile} with all quality findings, Document specific best practices violations, Provide actionable recommendations, Load {nextStepFile} for final readiness assessment."
