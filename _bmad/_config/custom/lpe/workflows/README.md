# LPE Workflows

LPE has no step-file workflows. All module capability is delivered through Viper's agent prompt commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[GP]` Generate Prompt | Generates a Lovable AI prompt from a story identifier |
| `[SC]` Show Constraints | Displays the standard architectural constraint block |

These commands are defined in the agent YAML and execute inline — no multi-step workflow files needed.
